Remember those days when we were together all the time. No missing each other, No worries of waiting to see each other next. Ya, How can I forget these memories? These were the days where our love maybe not love but we came close to each other. Those late night talks, and teasing by our friends by shouting my name when u enter the class and shouting your name when I enter the class.  I know I used to be super awkward, but thanks to them, maybe they are one of the reasons we are together.  The first dare, of going somewhere and spending the entire night with each other. Really from where did we get all dose ideas from? we were really mad in friendship right. </p>

<!-- Remember the farewell night and the next day we headed to puri again, ya we had a lot of dispute rather I had . But those were the best time I would have ever spent with someone. Ya I know we had to head back from our dream world to the reality. And the time of parting. Do u Remeber u had chucked down almost a bottle of beer? OH MY GOD!!. U are such a drunker. That weirdo face pic of yours, remember in the terrace and probably the day before we were to live for puri after our farewell. Chiranjit, Me, You, and Sonali too. I really wanted to say how special u are but I just don't know why i didn't at that time. Maybe because we were getting apart and in some corner of my mind I had this perception that maybe we would ever meet again.  But u changed everything. I love you, my baby.</p> -->

As u would have guessed from the caption itself, but still I will remind u of the how embarrassed u were of wearing those sports shoes with that traditional wear , when we were about to leave for temple darshan.  After giving u a long lecture of about 20 mins about how u shouldn't be affected about what others think u finally ended u wearing those. U know the best part of that lecture, u still implement it. This is one of your behavior which made me fall for u. Ahh!! I still remember those lovely evening sitting by the beachside and talking for hours about soo many things starting from your family to mine to just don't know we really talked a lot dat evening. One of my sweetest evening I had spent. </p>

Ya, The last minute asking u out for lunch, during our last days in college. Remember this pic, on the terrace of the computer science department of our college. Remember how Charanjit and Sonali were commenting on us how well we know each other. Ya, that was one of the proudest moment for me .. Hahaha but that's true we really know each other so well. Till now also ,  and u have too. I have to admit u didn't know me so well at that time the way u do now. But I know u so well since then. We were even excited about going to puri the next day. Truly Chiranjit was truly trying his luck to impress Sonali. I remember, we went to eat ice cream and Sonali threw the ice cream as she didn't like it.  U know what, the weirdness in u have grown rather from that time, U look the prettiest when u smile. I just love it.</p>

Ya, Afterall we were locked in the room as per your instructions, so this is one of the photos taken from our personal photography session that happened in the hotel room. Truly speaking, I didn't even realize how the time passed by. We were so much involved with each other, we didn't realize we were going to be apart. But we were happy that we had such a great time with each other. I was happy that I have made such an awesome friend ,  but ya at the same time sad, if we may ever possibly meet after this. But u know what, maybe we were destined to be together. And your love for me drove me crazy to madly fall in love with you.</p>

Thought that this was the last meet. Remember we even went to the KFC kitchen to see how the things were made. U really look pretty in this picture though. That long drive to Talcher from Cuttack in Swastik's car. U smoked a puff of cigarette which made u so sick. Making u sleep in the car's backseat, one of the loveliest moment in the trip. OH, How can I forget how to just drunk almost the whole bottle of beer, just to control the emotions, Really Baby...Honestly speaking, I didn't realize how sadi was till I reached home. That dose of sadness hit me hard when I reached home and woke up the next day morning. Nothing was the same. Everything was gone. I felt so alone. I missed u, I missed the friends with whom I spent 4 years. But Baby u were always with me, U were always available to me. Ya at the start I know I behaved like an idiot. I am extremely sorry for it. Baby, Ur innocence, ur purity in thoughts, ur possessiveness, hayeee mo bachaa.. muuuuuuuaaah love u yaar, just love u a lot.</p>

My strong super girl, who didnt knew how to eat of her own ,  was going to lead an independent life. Ya the job life. I remember those cries and that restlessness u had of leading that independent life. And how u promised me that u will never ever make me get through that hardship that u had faced. Baby how could u love me so much. I just don't know what I did so good that I got u, rather I did something fantastic thats why God told me "Abey Gadhe yeh le, isko Rakh Kahan chodh raha hei iss pyaar si pari ko". ya my angel, my love, I heart u baba... I know u have never been there for you. Rather I was so harsh to u, by restricting my timing and avoiding to talk with u. I had my Gate preparations at that time. But u are really a tough warrior. U are a brave strong girl. U fought and overcome all of ur fears and stood strong no matter what. This helps me to fight when I feel low of things not happening right. U are a motivation to me. Love u, my warrior.</p>

Baby, I know the last meet that was not as great as the previous ones, we quarreled a lot, we wanted to sort things out, we really had a lot of confusion brewing inside of us, a lot of misunderstandings. And also the travelings delay of your train made the condition much worse. Baby, I know my new life here in NIT brought a lot of bad days for us. But baba those were all just misunderstandings that were all growing up. We even quarreled on that trip too. We met Omkar and his girlfriend too. We stayed a number of days with each other. We did face a lot of troubles on this trip. You know what this sometimes makes me realize that ya we meet less than 3-4 times in a year but it's not always that our meetings will be lovely nice and good, sometimes it becomes just bad as this one or even worse. But the main thing is how we are together and face situations. I know we had a bad trip but we had really some good memories too. We realized that we still care for each other and no one what happens or how much we quarrel we will never be parted. Ya, we both say a lot of time, in angerness lets be apart but we both know that no matter what we will be together forever. Baba, I know there will be bad times with good times. I can't guarantee you that u will always be smiling with me. Maybe sometime u will get angry and fight with me or maybe me , we will quarrel fight  but baba, we will be together and I know when we are together we are the best of ourselves and, hey love I proposed u unofficially with an unofficial ring and u said me YES so now I will make sure all these things will become official . Dulhan toh tu hin banegi meri. Love You Sweetheart.</p>

Baby, I really wanted to make your my love's birthday the much special, I just don't know what happened. How all these quarrels started up and we ended up fighting with each other. I know it is one of the special days, and i should not have behaved the way I have. I m really sorry for all the doings that I had done, Baby trust me I m really sorry from the bottom of my heart. Ya, I just wanted to make one disclosure, and that is I have been behaving rudely with u, not rude actually !! but kind of ignoring u because I wanted to gift u something special on this day. This idea just struck into my mind in the afternoon and thought of working on it. So all the stories that are being made up about me being busy are nothing but working on this gift of yours. I just don't know if u like it or not, the thing is I just felt like sharing all of the memories that we had till now in a bundle to you and let u know how special u are to me and baby, trust me I care for u a lot. I know i really behaved rudely in the evening and even now also. I cut the call baba, I really wanted to complete this and gift u as soon as possible. I am really really really really sorry for being so mean and rude to u. Baby, please na forgive me na!!... I really really really really really love u a lot. More than a lot. </p>
